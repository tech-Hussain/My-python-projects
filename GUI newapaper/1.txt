Former Pakistan cricket team captain and current Head Coach Misbah ul Haq said that openers, despite being out-of-form, should not be changed after one or two series. 
Misbah was speaking to media virtually where he admitted that Pakistani openers were currently "out-of-form". 
"We will work on their mistakes, I will be present in the National High Performance Centre and we will work on them [openers] for a month-and-a-half."
Misbah said that Pakistan cannot afford to waste its openers, adding that they should not be dropped after only one or two series.
"We will work on Abid Ali, Shan Masood, Imran Butt and Abdullah Shafique because only they are the ones who are performing at the moment [among openers in the domestic circuit]," he said.
'Players have a lot of potential'
The Pakistani head coach said that after trouncing South Africa 2-0 in the series, the green shirts' morale was high. He said the team will attempt to continue their winning run in the T20s as well.
