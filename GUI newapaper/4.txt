Hilarity ensued during an "unprecedented" bat-flip on Thursday to decide the course of play as Brisbane Heat and Perth Scorchers faced off for the final match of the Big Bash League's (BBL) 10th season.

Ahead of the BBL 10 final, as Perth Scorchers captain Ashton Turner and Brisbane Heat captain Chris Lynn waited to see who got to bat first, the bat instead landed on its edge twice, causing both cricketers and onlookers to laugh at the surprising turn of events.

At the first attempt, the bat-flip was perhaps not as surprising but when it occurred for the second time, both teams' captains were left shocked, with boos and yays from those around them.
